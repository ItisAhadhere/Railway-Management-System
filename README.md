## ⚙️ Technologies Used

- SQL (tested in MySQL)
- ERD designed with dbdiagram.io 
- Data entered manually and through SQL scripts

---

## 📌 Key Features

- **Table Creation**: Comprehensive schema for booking, ticketing, transactions, cancellations, and scheduling
- **Data Insertion**: Sample datasets to populate and test the system
- **Queries**: Useful SQL queries for insights (e.g., most booked routes, cancellations, revenue tracking)

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/rms-database-project.git
   cd rms-database-project
   ```

2. Open your SQL interface (e.g., MySQL Workbench, DBeaver, psql)

3. Run scripts in order:
   - `FinalCode.sql`
   - `Queries.sql`

## 🔍 Example Queries

- List active trains with schedules  
- Top 5 passengers by bookings  
- Revenue by payment method  
- Passenger names starting with 'A'  
- Ticket prices above threshold
